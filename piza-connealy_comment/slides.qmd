## Purpose

Police withdrawal occurring during CHOP supposedly provides a quasi-experiment of what happens when you remove policing from an area

They specifically refer to police abolishment in the paper, implying abolition would result in CHOP-like conditions

## Their strategy

Synthetic control

## Their findings

# Counterfactuals


## Potential Outcomes

<br>

![](img/po_basic.svg)

::: {.notes} 

Causal effects are differences between factual outcomes we observe and counterfactual outcomes that we imagine could have happened.

We only observe one of these--the factual outcome--so the main challenge of causal inference is estimating the one we don't observe--the counterfactual
:::


## Ignorability

<br>

![](img/po_ignorability.svg)

::: {.notes}
We usually do this by substituting observed values from similar units in for the unobserved ones

We can compare different units if their differences are **ignorable**

We do this with *randomization*, *conditioning* on variables, or, in the present case a weighted combination of other cases.
:::

## What is our counterfactual?

Seems like this is really about Y0A not being what they think it is?

# Piza & Connealy Revisited

## Implicit causal model



```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="EB Garamond", fontcolor="#333d4d"]
  edge [color="#333d4d"]
  
  chop [pos = "2,  1!", label = "CHOP Zone"]
  crime [pos = "3,  0!", label = "Crime"]
  place [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Measured\nPlace\nCharacteristics"]
  protest [pos = "1,  0!", label = "Protest"]

  chop -> crime
  place -> {crime, chop}
  protest -> {chop, crime} [style="dashed", color="#da9262"]
}
```

Assumptions: 

* Primary: *Protest* is independent of *CHOP Zone* and/or *Crime*
* Secondary: No unmeasured *Place Characteristics* are relevant

## Timeline

![](img/timeline_plot.png)

## Problems

It is not conceivable the police pullout would have occurred absent the large-scale protest and repeat conflicts with police

The police pulled out *because* clashes with police were escalating.

No comparison units had a large-scale protest against police occurring in them; places with similar crime rates leading up to CHOP did not have similar reasons for those crime rates.

> Show chop zone pictures

> Show pictures not during chop

Huge fucking influx of people *prior* to CHOP

## Secondary Issues

* Interference: Protests and police withdrawal caused shifts across city

## What did crime *actually* do after the pullout?

Show trend plots of rapid decline at start, rapid increase at end

Police-reported crime in CHOP zone is in large part due to police activity

This reflects that police left precinct to de-escalate (prevent more contacts) and things re-escalated, briefly, when they returned.

## Pre-Event Trends

Much larger "treatment effect" if we date treatment at start of Cap Hill protests than start of CHOP

## Capitol Hill

![](img/cap-hill.png)

List of measured place characteristics; do these explain cap hill?

History of protests, protests after CHOP

Similar patterns in crime occurred in Capitol Hill absent police withdrawal on July 25th, 2020 due to detention center protest.

This is because Capitol Hill is an unusual area of Seattle with physical and social characteristics that make protests and conflicts with police more likely

## What is the counterfactual?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### Observed

How many reported crimes occurred after police withdrew to de-escalate conflict with an existing large-scale protest against police

:::
::: {.column}
#### Counterfactual

How many reported crimes would have occurred if neither the protest nor the withdrawal occurred

:::
::::

Critically, the difference between these does not tell us if withdrawing from the East Precinct increased crime

## Summary {.dark-slide}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

Design

* Theory needs to be correct
* Theory requires contextual understanding

:::

::: {.column}

Substance

* Estimate does not correspond to any useful estimand
* "CHOP effect" is not likely to generalize
