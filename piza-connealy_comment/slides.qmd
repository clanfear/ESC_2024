## The Capitol Hill Occupied Protest {.r-fit-text}

![](img/rs_chop.jpg)

::: {.notes}

In the wake of the death of George Floyd, protests happened throughout the US.

In Seattle, they began with marches (and a riot) downtown but coalesced around the Eastern police precinct in Capitol Hill 

Here, protestors battled with police for days before SPD eventually withdrew from the building and the area around it for almost a month. 

People flooded into the area to engage in the protest and police abolishment movement.

During the protest period, there were seven shootings in the area

Disclosure: I was living in Seattle when this occurred.

I considered adding a map showing where the authors were living but it seemed like a cheap shot, though I do believe understanding the local context is important

## CHOP timeline

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](img/background_plot.png)

The CHOP lasted 24 days: June 8th to July 1st

## Their question

&nbsp;

### [*Did SPD's withdrawal increase crime?*]{.center}

&nbsp;

> The geographically focused, time limited nature of CHOP provides an opportunity for a **natural experiment** to test the effect of the autonomous zone on crime. Given the context of CHOP, this study may further be considered **a test of police abolition**, the most radical proposal advanced in the police defunding movement. (Piza & Connealy 2022:36)

## Piza & Connealy's strategy

&nbsp;

Microsynthetic control approach:

::: {.incremental}

1. Treat police withdrawal as quasi-experimental treatment
2. Match 36 "treated" street segments^[They also considered two larger zones] to similar untreated "controls" among >20,000 candidate segments across city using:
   * Time-invariant place characteristics
   * Crime counts in 6-day periods covering prior year
3. Compare total crime counts in treated and untreated groups in four 6-day periods---the 24 days of the CHOP^[Including July 1st was an error, but we'll get to that]

:::


## Matching variables

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="46%"}

**Continuous:**

* **6-day period police-recorded crime counts** (the only time-varying measure)
*	Count of commercial businesses
*	Count of consumer-facing facing establishments
*	Block group crime density
*	Length of the street segment

:::

::: {.column width="8%"}

&nbsp;

:::

::: {.column width="46%"}

**Binary:**

*	Principal vs arterial street
*	If pre-CHOP total crime > 80th percentile
*	If police beat > 80th percentile of police calls
*	In block group with > mean disadvantage
*	In block group with > mean non-white residents, residents 15-29, vacant homes, and owned/rented homes

:::

## Their findings

> Results indicate **crime significantly increased** in the CHOP zone, the encompassing two-block area, and the overall East precinct service area. (Piza & Connealy 2022:35)

> The current study found comparatively stronger effects than the general literature on depolicing. The significant crime increase is particularly noteworthy given the short time frame of the CHOP occupation and retreat of police from the area theoretically making it more challenging for crimes to be reported by citizens and/or proactively discovered by officers.  This suggests that **police abolition**, the most extreme form of the police defunding movement, **may significantly compromise public safety**. (Piza & Connealy 2022:35â€“36)

## Disclosure {.dark-slide}

I was contracted by the City of Seattle expert legal report in a lawsuit by Seattle business owners against the City of Seattle for damages related to the police withdrawal from the East Precinct:

&nbsp;

**CC Lanfear. 2022. Expert Report: Hunters Capital, LLC v. City of Seattle (client). *Case No. 20-cv-00983 TSZ, US District Court, Western District of Washington***

# Counterfactuals


## Potential Outcomes

<br>

![](img/po_basic.svg)

::: {.notes} 

Causal effects are differences between factual outcomes we observe and counterfactual outcomes that we imagine could have happened.

We only observe one of these--the factual outcome--so the main challenge of causal inference is estimating the one we don't observe--the counterfactual
:::


## Ignorability

<br>

![](img/po_ignorability.svg)

::: {.notes}
We usually do this by substituting observed values from similar units in for the unobserved ones

We can compare different units if their differences are **ignorable**

We do this with *randomization*, *conditioning* on variables, or, in the present case a weighted combination of other cases.
:::

## What is our counterfactual?

&nbsp;

Causal inference hinges on having the right counterfactual.

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment}
What if we don't know what $Y_{A}^{0}$ we want?

What if the $Y_{B}^{0}$ we have is not similar to $Y_{A}^{0}$?
:::

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment .center}
*This is Piza & Connealy's problem*
:::

# Revisiting Piza & Connealy

## Implicit causal model

```{dot}
#| cache: true
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="EB Garamond", fontcolor="#333d4d"]
  edge [color="#333d4d"]
  
  chop [pos = "2,  1!", label = "CHOP Zone"]
  crime [pos = "3,  0!", label = "Crime"]
  place [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Measured\nPlace\nCharacteristics"]
  protest [pos = "1,  0!", label = "Protest"]

  chop -> crime
  place -> {crime, chop}
  protest -> {chop, crime} [style="dashed", color="#da9262"]
}
```

Assumptions: 

* Primary: *Protest* is independent of *CHOP Zone* and/or *Crime*
* Secondary: No unmeasured *Place Characteristics* are relevant


## Problems


* *Protest* definitely caused *CHOP Zone* and probably caused *Crime*
   * It is not conceivable the police pullout would have occurred absent the large-scale protest and repeat conflicts with police
   * The police pulled out *because* clashes with police were escalating
   * *Protest* caused **massive** increase in ambient population
   
::: {.fragment}

* *Measured Place Characteristics* don't explain why *Protest* or *CHOP Zone* occurred
   * Places with similar characteristics--including crime--did not have large-scale protests
   * Capitol Hill has unique social-ecological characteristics associated with protest

## Protest Capitol Hill

![](img/rs_chop.jpg)

## Typical "time-invariant" Capitol Hill

![](img/google-street-view.png)


## Capitol Hill is where protests happen

&nbsp;

![](img/cap-hill.png)

> Seattle's protest stood out from the national activity due to their extreme magnitude and duration, particularly^["only" would have been suitable here] in the context of the Capitol Hill neighborhood. (Piza & Connealy 2022:36)



[*Capitol Hill is an unusual area of prone to protests and conflicts with police*]{.center}


## {}

![](img/timeline_plot.png)

Crime spiked in Capitol Hill absent police withdrawal on July 25th, 2020 due to *another* protest.


## What is their counterfactual?

Given these issues, what are Piza & Connealy estimating?

&nbsp;

::::: {.fragment}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="46%"}
**$Y_A^1$ they observed**

How many crimes occurred after police withdrew to de-escalate conflict with an existing large-scale protest against police

:::

::: {.column width="8%"}

&nbsp;

:::

::: {.column width="46%"}

**$Y_B^0$ they estimated**

How many crimes would have occurred if neither the protest nor the withdrawal occurred^[This is a compound treatment]

:::

::::

:::::

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment}

Critically, the difference between these does not tell us if withdrawing from the East Precinct increased crime

:::

## What counterfactual did they want?

Piza & Connealy's (2022) counterfactual is only implied:^[They never even use the word "counterfactual"]

> A more prudent solution \[than withdrawing\] would have been to more effectively engage with protesters to quell the violent activity. (52) 

**Implied $Y_B^0$:** How many crimes would have occurred if police had remained but de-escalated the conflict

::: {.fragment}

But recall SPD withdrew to **de-escalate** after exhausting options:

> SPD abandoned the precinct in an attempt to quell the confrontations, resulting property damage, and injuries to both police officers and protestors. (36)

:::

## {}

![](img/timeline_plot.png)

Police-reported crime in CHOP zone is in large part due to police activity:

* Higher *before* withdrawal
* Highest when SPD returned

## Plausible counterfactuals

Even if they could estimate it, their implied counterfactual is **implausible**

::: {.fragment}

But other realistic counterfactuals exist:

**Alternative $Y_B^0$:** How many reported crimes would have occurred had...

* SPD continued battling protestors?^[This occurred in Portland, OR]
* SPD suppressed the protest?
* The national guard been deployed?^[This occurred in Minneapolis, MN]

:::


::: {.fragment}
Is it likely these counterfactuals would produce similar conclusions?
:::





## Takeaways {.dark-slide}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="46%"}

**In general**

* Know and be clear about counterfactuals
* Counterfactuals come from theory, so know your theory
* Be critical consumers and reviewers

:::

::: {.column width="8%"}

&nbsp;

:::

::: {.column width="46%"}

**This paper**

* Estimate does not correspond to any useful estimand
* Provides no information on depolicing effects
* Other cities may offer valid counterfactuals (e.g., Portland, Minneapolis)
