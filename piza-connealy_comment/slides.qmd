## Background

## Timeline

![](img/background_plot.png)


## Their Question

### Did SPD's withdrawal increase crime?

> The geographically focused, time limited nature of CHOP provides an opportunity for a natural experiment to test the effect of the autonomous zone on crime. Given the context of CHOP, this study may further be considered a test of police abolition, the most radical proposal advanced in the police defunding movement.

## Piza & Connealy's Strategy

Microsynthetic control approach:

1. Treat police withdrawal as quasi-experimental treatment
2. Match "treated" street segments to similar untreated "controls"
3. Compare crime counts between treatment groups


## {}

![](img/chop_map.png)

36 street segments in CHOP Zone

## Matching Variables {.r-fit-text}

Continuous:

* **6-day period police-recorded crime counts**
*	Count of commercial businesses
*	Count of consumer-facing facing establishments
*	Block group crime density
*	Length of the street segment

Binary:

*	Principal vs arterial street
*	If pre-CHOP total crime > 80th percentile
*	If police beat > 80th percentile of police calls
*	In block group with > mean disadvantage
*	In block group with > mean non-white residents, residents 15-29, vacant homes, and owned/rented homes


## Their findings

> Results indicate crime significantly increased in the CHOP zone, the encompassing two-block area, and the overall East precinct service area.

> The current study found comparatively stronger effects than the general literature on depolicing. The significant crime increase is particularly noteworthy given the short time frame of the CHOP occupation and retreat of police from the area theoretically making it more challenging for crimes to be reported by citizens and/or proactively discovered by officers.  This suggests that **police abolition**, the most extreme form of the police defunding movement, **may significantly compromise public safety**.

# Counterfactuals


## Potential Outcomes

<br>

![](img/po_basic.svg)

::: {.notes} 

Causal effects are differences between factual outcomes we observe and counterfactual outcomes that we imagine could have happened.

We only observe one of these--the factual outcome--so the main challenge of causal inference is estimating the one we don't observe--the counterfactual
:::


## Ignorability

<br>

![](img/po_ignorability.svg)

::: {.notes}
We usually do this by substituting observed values from similar units in for the unobserved ones

We can compare different units if their differences are **ignorable**

We do this with *randomization*, *conditioning* on variables, or, in the present case a weighted combination of other cases.
:::

## What is our counterfactual?

Seems like this is really about Y0A not being what they think it is?


# Piza & Connealy Revisited

## Implicit causal model



```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="EB Garamond", fontcolor="#333d4d"]
  edge [color="#333d4d"]
  
  chop [pos = "2,  1!", label = "CHOP Zone"]
  crime [pos = "3,  0!", label = "Crime"]
  place [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Measured\nPlace\nCharacteristics"]
  protest [pos = "1,  0!", label = "Protest"]

  chop -> crime
  place -> {crime, chop}
  protest -> {chop, crime} [style="dashed", color="#da9262"]
}
```

Assumptions: 

* Primary: *Protest* is independent of *CHOP Zone* and/or *Crime*
* Secondary: No unmeasured *Place Characteristics* are relevant

## Timeline

## Problems

It is not conceivable the police pullout would have occurred absent the large-scale protest and repeat conflicts with police

The police pulled out *because* clashes with police were escalating.

No comparison units had a large-scale protest against police occurring in them; places with similar crime rates leading up to CHOP did not have similar reasons for those crime rates.

> Show chop zone pictures

> Show pictures not during chop

Huge fucking influx of people *prior* to CHOP; comparison units do not have similar conditions

> Seattle's protest stood out from the national activity due to their extreme magnitude and duration, particularly in the context of the Capitol Hill neighborhood. (Piza & Connealy 2020:36)


## What did crime *actually* do after the pullout?

Show trend plots of rapid decline at start, rapid increase at end

Police-reported crime in CHOP zone is in large part due to police activity

This reflects that police left precinct to de-escalate (prevent more contacts) and things re-escalated, briefly, when they returned.

## Pre-Event Trends

Much larger "treatment effect" if we date treatment at start of Cap Hill protests than start of CHOP

## Capitol Hill

![](img/cap-hill.png)

List of measured place characteristics; do these explain cap hill?

History of protests, protests after CHOP

Similar patterns in crime occurred in Capitol Hill absent police withdrawal on July 25th, 2020 due to detention center protest.

This is because Capitol Hill is an unusual area of Seattle with physical and social characteristics that make protests and conflicts with police more likely

## What is the counterfactual?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### Observed

How many reported crimes occurred after police withdrew to de-escalate conflict with an existing large-scale protest against police

:::
::: {.column}
#### Counterfactual

How many reported crimes would have occurred if neither the protest nor the withdrawal occurred

:::
::::

Critically, the difference between these does not tell us if withdrawing from the East Precinct increased crime

## Summary {.dark-slide}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

Design

* Theory needs to be correct
* Know your counterfactual
* Other cities may offer valid counterfactuals (e.g., Portland)

:::

::: {.column}

Substance

* Estimate does not correspond to any useful estimand
* "CHOP effect" is not likely to generalize
